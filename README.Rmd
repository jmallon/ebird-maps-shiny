The `Rmd` has also been published on [RPubs](http://rpubs.com/hrbrmstr/ggvis-maps) and there's a [blog post](http://rud.is/b/2014/12/29/making-static-interactive-maps-with-ggvis-using-ggvis-maps-wshiny/) with slightly more expository than the code.

One of the caveats with `ggvis` is that you need an online context for interactively (making things like interactive choropleths useless without such a context). You'd need to account for this in the `Rmd` by setting up a faux-facet series for the maps, either with a `<table>` or `<div>` grid.
